# TUM-AI-project

This project was provided for Artificial Intelligence for Biotechnology Course.  The goal of this challenge was to assess the toxicity of more than 12k
chemical compounds for 12 toxic effects for two important pathways: the nuclear receptor
and the stress response pathway (Mayr et al., 2016; Drwal et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2014).
#####  The dataset contains approximately 12k chemical compounds with more than 800 features.
